# CIEpy

This Python script allows you to quickly access past papers for subjects like Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics from the Cambridge International Examination (CIE) repository.

## How It Works

The script prompts users to input specific details to generate the URL for accessing past papers. It covers the following inputs:

- **Subject Selection:** Users choose a subject from Mathematics, Chemistry, or Physics.
- **Year:** Input the year of the desired past paper.
- **Session:** Select the session of the paper (s for May/June, m for March, w for October/November).
- **Variant and Paper:** Input the variant and paper number (e.g., 13 for Pure Maths 1 Variant 3).
- **Type of Paper:** Choose between "Mark scheme" or "Question paper".

The script then generates the URL leading to the downloadable PDF of the selected past paper.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/https_bayleaf/ciepy.git
    cd ciepy
    ```

2. **Run the Script**
    ```
    python ciepy.py
    ```
    Follow the prompts to input the details as requested.
