# CIEpy
CIEpy is a tool for A-Level students to quickly generate links to past A-Level papers. It allows you to pick the subject, year, session and variant of the past paper, all within a graphical user interface (GUI).
CIEpy was built with Python, and uses TKinter for GUI support and Web Browser for opening URLs. URL generated are from PapaCambridge.
